# PCF-DragAndDropGrid

This control allows the user to drag and drop files onto entity records in the grid. \
The dropped files will be added as Dynamics 365 attachments.

You just need to change the sub-grid control to the “BeverControls.DragAndDropGrid”.

- **Note Title –** Title of notes added by this control.
- **Note Description –** Description of notes added by this control.

Both properties can be bound to a “Single Line of Text” field.

There is the **Attachments** column at the very end of the sub-grid. \
As soon as you click on the button in the **Attachments** column of the coresponding row, a pop-up window with attachments will open.
